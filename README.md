# Full stack Ruby on Rails and Postgres application (employee management)

<p>
This is the code to accompany the tutorial available at our <a href="https://docs.withcoherence.com/coherence-templates/full-stack-template/?tabs=rubyonrails">Framework Guide (Ruby on Rails)</a> page.
</p>

You can use it as a starting point for any full stack Rails application. Read the guide to see how to deploy it to a production environment in your own cloud, or see the instructions below to run a development version of it locally.

## Getting Started 

Fork the repository to your GitHub account. To test locally, clone the forked repository to your machine. You will need to have Docker installed.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/ruby-on-rails-postgres-employees-demo.git
cd ruby-on-rails-postgres-employees-demo
docker compose up 
```

After a successful build, the application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Run migrations when prompted.
